Technical Details
=================

This section explores the technical implementation and architecture of MuSS, with a focus on socket communication used for real-time data exchange.

Socket Communication
--------------------

**Implementation:**
- MuSS and WimDA communicate using TCP/IP sockets to ensure reliable data transfer.
- MuSS acts as the server while WimDA operates as the client.

**Architecture:**
- Both applications must be running, with MuSS listening for incoming connections.
- Data is transmitted sequentially to prevent loss or corruption.

**Setup:**
- Configure the host and port correctly in MuSS.
- Ensure the server is set to listen and that WimDA can connect without firewall restrictions.
